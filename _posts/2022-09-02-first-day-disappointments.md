I tend to prefer to study in English. This is because I work in IT, and English is a generally accepted languaged used worldwide for any work in this sector. Regardless of the country, company, or the area they serve, people speak English. Except when they're German, for whatever reason.

In my Bachelor's Studies, my class was mostly foreign speakers come to study in English. There were a few native <Language> speakers, but the class was mostly made up of students from various Asian or African countries. Chinese, Nepalese, Nigerian, Ethiopian students were common, and the environment was rich and multi-cultural.

Now I've started my Master's Studies, another curriculum that is intended to be taught in English. Yet somehow, the class is 90% <Native> men.

This is not the kind of environment I was expecting. But we'll see how things go as we progress.
