I finally finished the first Witcher game now. I'm still not sure why. Since the first Chapter the combat was ridiculously clumsy and repetitive and towards the end of Chapter 5 I was thinking 'Please god let this end already.' The epilogue kind of pulled it back for me though.

But really, who designed that combat system? I have the Enhanced Edition and it felt like it needed some major improvements. I can't imagine what it was like before the massive overhaul. I also couldn't stand the villains and their methods. "We'll taunt you, get beaten quickly and easily and then teleport away. Repeatedly, for the duration of the entire game." I don't get how a hero falls for that more than one time. You put a knife through their leg, watch them try to run away then.

The story was clumsy in places too, but overall it was the only thing that kept me coming back to finish it. God knows it wasn't the gameplay. I particularly liked the parts where you'd lose a big portion of your health before your screen had properly loaded or you'd drawn a weapon. The lack of customization didn't help. Sure, you had different styles but they were a requirement for different monsters rather than a choice.

I might pick up the Witcher 2 when I have some time to kill and it costs 10e like the first one did.

In all honesty, I played it for the sex. For all the fun of digital boobs. I am a god. A sad, sad god.
