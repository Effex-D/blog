I like Metal Gear Survive.

I think there's a lot of cases where nerds let their expectations carry them away, and then dislike perfectly good media for no reason other than it's not exactly what they wanted.

This is what I think happened to Metal Gear Survive. It was the first, and last, Metal Gear game to be released after the departure of Hideo Kojima from Konami in 2015. This was held against it by the "leave our boi alone" crowd. Hideo Kojima gets the same treatment as From Software. Basically a pass to make any design choices, questionable or otherwise, and his fanboys will lap it up.

Conversely, when Konami released Metal Gear Survive, they couldn't have released it in any way which would have been satisfactory to these people. The copy could have been delivered by their favourite JAV actress, who would fellate them while the updates installed and they would still dislike the game.

It's the same as any live action versions of Anime. Anime is just... not that good. I'm sure some are, but some are average, and some are shit, but because of the "Random place - Random place, Japan" phenomenon, nerds go wild.

So let's talk about what's wrong with Metal Gear Survive. The story is okay. The voice acting is fairly low quality. It's a bit grindy, and only having one character slot (without micro-transactions) was shitty. I agree.

But the gameplay loop is a solid use of MGS mechanics inside a zombie survival game. Combat is more fun than it has ever been in the stealth based games. Movement is fluid, gameplay is enjoyable.

So... where's the problem? Sure it's a saturated genre but... who cares? It's a fair entry.

But the biggest issue is what we lost. Mixing the survival gameplay with a traditional MGS game would have given us the potential for a rambo-style incursion scenario, making a bow to silently take down terrorists, building traps and fences and molotov cocktails to impede them.

I'm playing it now for the fourth time.

It's a solid game. But it isn't doing exactly what Kojima got away with for decades.

And let's be fair, some of Kojima's design choices were... pretty questionable at best.

Anyone remember MGS2's naked Raiden section? Or... Raiden in general?
The 9 hour ladder climb from MGS3?
Revolver Ocelot (Revolver Ocelot).
Fatman on Rollerskates.
That one boss made of bees.
