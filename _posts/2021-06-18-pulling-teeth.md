Okay, solved that issue. Turns out I needed to include the baseurl in the part of the pages that generates the URLs, otherwise it fails.

This happens a lot in IT. IT is basically just smacking your head against a problem until the problem breaks. Or your head does. But when studying, they don't *tell* you this is what IT is. They give you neat little CompSci problems that have neat little outcomes that make you go "Cool I made a thing, look mom."

I think it's the reason I have imposter syndrome. It doesn't matter how many years I*m in the field, or how many people tell me I'm doing a good job, I never feel quite like I belong. Like I'm just pretending I know what I'm doing, and by this point I've learned enough to fake it **really** well.

Don't fall victim to it like I did.

On a more entertaining note, I figured out how to add an author to the posts. Neat.

At the moment, to make a new post, I'm copying an old post, editing the time/date/title etc and rewriting. I should write a small bash script that would spit out a blank blog post with correct timestamp.
