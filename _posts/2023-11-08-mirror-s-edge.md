The problem with waiting for games instead of getting them when they come out is you see it in game stores and think 'I could play that'.

The good thing about waiting is, having played Mirror's Edge now for 2 hours, I'd have felt cheated if I paid more than what I did for it (and I didn't pay very much at all)

It's a terrible game. While the idea is quite cool you spend a great deal of time falling off buildings because your character doesn't actually do what you tell her to do. The combat seems to have been added as a clumsy after thought and your character is realistically weak. Half the time you'll die before you actually reach the enemy because you go down in one or two of their shots. Otherwise you land on them, take their gun and kill everything else around.

As Rock, Paper, Shotgun mentioned in response to the recent teaser trailer for a sequel. "Mirror’s Edge wasn’t actually that good." I guess it's now been long enough that people have forgotten the frustrating level design where you spend most of your time memorizing a sequence of moves instead of the dynamic action we were all promised in the trailer. In their defence they couldn't really do it any other way. Take Assassin's Creed for example. There you rarely fall while running across the rooftops and if you do it's your own dumb fault for not gauging a jump right. A great deal of fun in those games can come from simply punching a guard in the face and then fleeing across the town.

In Mirror's Edge all there is is fleeing and as it was designed to be a 3d platform-sort of game, the way you fail is falling. Repeatedly. While your character decides she doesn't want to wallrun on that particular attempt because you were seven millimeters too far away from the wall or facing 9 degrees in the wrong direction.

#### Update

I just finished Mirror's Edge, not because it was worth playing but because I refused to let such brain-fart of a game beat me. The sections where you'd lose 3 minutes of climbing repeatedly because the wall that you had to run along was not set up to run along properly. The combat was as simple as press R to slow down time, steal the nearest persons gun and kill everything else in the room. Just don't get shot, because your character can't take more than 2 bullets (realistic, sure. Irritating in a game which doesn't focus on the combat? Absolutely.)

It was 8-10 hours of pure frustration coupled with the occasional 'This is kinda cool' feeling when you're running across rooftops that gets quickly buried under the fact you're being constantly shot at.

Was a waste of time, and not in the good way.

Thankfully Dead Space has turned out much better in a Silent Hill survival horror kind of way. While I love horror games, those like Amnesia and the Slenderman games just don't grab me because... well, when shit starts going down, how is your first reaction not to arm up? Isaac from Dead Space, armed with his laser-based cutting tool and remote control chainsaw, agrees with me. The big downside of it is they added ammo as the limiting factor and I hate that in combat-oriented games. There's nothing more frustrating than walking into a room full of enemies only to completely drain your ammo reserves (I'm not even joking, last room of enemies I went through drained *everything* I had.) and the enemies are overly tough. I liked the Mass Effect system of 1 headshot == 1 kill. Dead Space's enemies you have to empty an entire clip on or be a master sharpshooter to cut off each of their limbs, made difficult by the fact they're typical aliens with very unpredictable and absurdly fast movements and a control system that was optimized for an xbox controller rather than a mouse (you have that little bit of drag at the start of aiming, regardless of the input media. Excellent for controllers, awful for a mouse.)

Well, still have Crysis 2 if it can run on my rig.
