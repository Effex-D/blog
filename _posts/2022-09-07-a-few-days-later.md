After the disappointment of the first day, I came to the table bright-eyed and bushy tailed for the second day which was much the same. Though it's not a particularly bad thing that the group is filled with Finns. This is Finland, and it makes sense that Finns would comprise the majority of the group. It's just not what I was expecting.

When I dropped my expectations, things seemed better. The group is made of generally sensible people, myself excluded. There's a wide range of both security knowledge and general experience, which is certainly a more diverse group than 35 supernerds sitting in the same room.

There are downsides, too. The first class is about security management systems. Which I maintain professionally. I was given the option to have the course recognized as prior learning, though I don't think I'll take it. I don't know everything about the idea of management systems. I'm a little concerned that it'll end up like my Bachelor's Degree, where I didn't learn anything, just had things I knew re-inforced.

But the positives outweigh it. Not only the schooling, the idea of getting a slightly higher education, but also the monthly excuse to travel. To spend a couple of nights in a city instead of my small town. To ride a train. I like trains.

It's fine to be a student again.

I better get started on my thesis.
