Today I had an idea. The idea was to write a book. A reference book of useful information for network and security engineers such as myself.

The original idea was to release it as a "handbook for security" and have sections about securing, and breaking, systems.

But then I had the idea to augment it.

What if I released such a book, but instead of being a boring affair used as a reference for 2-3 years before it became out of date, I added other parts.

I started thinking about Ready Player One and Anorak's Almanac. Useful information, coupled with other things. Thoughts, and streams of them. I started pulling together blog posts from widely flung places under this one banner. I'll need more. Lots more. But this is a start.

I'm retroactively writing some based on historical evidence, wondering if there's topics I should or shouldn't touch.

Can I include guides to romance?

Can I include references to the cities I've been?

Should I talk about music? A big part of my life, but one I've not really touched on here at all.
>> Thinking this made me think about adding tabs here, for songs, so that I can pull them up as a reference.

Then I could use AI to tag it all?

Hmm.

And then there's the last idea.

Could I embed a ARG inside the whole thing?

Hmm.
