One of my favourite things about Jekyll so far is the ability to post straight from my command line. No weird user-interface that posts to DBs. I understand why those exist. My wife has a blog, and she wouldn't be able to use a CLI to make posts.

But for me, the workflow is simple. Write a blog post in the file in the _posts folder, save it, use GIT to commit it to the repo and it just works. I'm in the CLI 90% of the time I'm working anyway, so it's second nature.

So yeah, flat file posting == big win from my perspective. Databases are complicated and rarely uesful.
