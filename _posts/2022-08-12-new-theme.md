I did it!

I managed to excise that damn Hacker theme, finally. Now I have a new theme. With a weird bar at the top from the original theme's download section but it's movement.

Edit: I managed to remove the bar by adding some over-ride CSS.

Now I'm happy.

Though I was still stupid, commiting all these changes to Master. Again. After realising that was a mistake the first time. And now it worked, so it encourages me not to be sensible in the future too.

But that's a problem for future me.

Present me is pleased with my new layout.
