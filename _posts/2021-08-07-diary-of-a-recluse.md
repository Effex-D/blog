I'm something of a recluse. And Covid has done nothing to improve the situation. My wife was away for a business trip over most of the last week.

Here is a log of my conversations over the last week.

´´´
Tuesday:

@Lunch: "One lunch please. Thanks."

Wednesday:

@Lunch: "One lunch please. Thanks."

Thursday:

@Lunch: "One lunch please. Thanks."

Friday:

@Lunch: "One lunch please. Thanks."
@Dinner: "Egg fried ride, please. Thanks."

Saturday:

@HardwareStore: "Thanks."
@GroceryStore: "Thanks."
@SushiPlace: "Thanks."

I'm a grown man, in my thirties, who has spoke exactly 24 words since Monday evening.

I see nothing wrong with this.
