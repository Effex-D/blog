The instructions for running Jekyll in Github pages is somehow quite... bad. Following the instructions exactly gives you a barely functioning website, and attempting to change the theme through Githubs theme changer breaks functionality completely.

I'm wondering why I started with github pages in the first place. I used to host my blog on my server.

I could do that again.

I could also host it locally and just reverse proxy from my server through to the local website.
