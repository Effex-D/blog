So a reset proved more complicated than expected, as they always seem to with my favourite distro.

I run Debian. I like it because I consider it secure. Safe.

And yet, every time I attempt... well, pretty much anything, I run into issues with versions of assorted software being far out of date.

This time it was ruby, which is running at 2.5.5 on Debian, with 2.7.6 the latest stable 2.x available, and 3 having been released up to 3.1.2.

Last time it was Python, with python 3.9 unavailable on Debian.

And to be honest, this happens every time.

I'll spin up an Ubuntu VM on my Proxmox server and start again from there.
